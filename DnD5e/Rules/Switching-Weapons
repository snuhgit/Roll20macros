&{template:traits}{{name=Other Activity on Your Turn}}{{description=Your turn can include a variety of flourishes that require neither your action nor your move.

You can communicate however you are able, through brief utterances and gestures, as you take your turn.

You can also interact with one object or feature of the environment for free, during either your move or your action. For example, you could open a door during your move as you stride toward a foe, or you could draw your weapon as part of the same action you use to attack.

If you want to interact with a second object, you need to use your action. Some magic items and other special objects always require an action to use, as stated in their descriptions.

The DM might require you to use an action for any of these activities when it needs special care or when it presents an unusual obstacle. For instance, the DM could reasonably expect you to use an action to open a stuck door or turn a crank to lower a drawbridge.

"Drawing or sheathing a weapon can be performed as your free item interaction for the round. If you want to sheathe one weapon while drawing another, that takes your main action; or you have to spread it across two rounds. You can also just drop your old weapon on the ground (without requiring an action), and then draw your new weapon as a free item interaction."}}
