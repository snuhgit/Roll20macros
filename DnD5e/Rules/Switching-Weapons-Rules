&{template:traits}{{source=5th Ed SRD and general consensus across rando Internet forums}}{{name=Switching Weapons in Combat}}{{description=Your turn can include a variety of flourishes that require neither your action nor your move.

You can communicate however you are able, through brief utterances and gestures, as you take your turn.

You can also interact with one object or feature of the environment for free, during either your move or your action. For example, you could open a door during your move as you stride toward a foe, or you could draw your weapon as part of the same action you use to attack.

If you want to interact with a second object, you need to use your action. Some magic items and other special objects always require an action to use, as stated in their descriptions.

The DM might require you to use an action for any of these activities when it needs special care or when it presents an unusual obstacle. For instance, the DM could reasonably expect you to use an action to open a stuck door or turn a crank to lower a drawbridge.

TLDR:

"Anyone who wishes to swap their active weapon and also enjoy swinging the new one can achieve this result by dropping their current weapon, without taking an action, and then use the item interaction to swap to the new weapon."

"e.g. Switching from a Bow to Sword+Shield can be performed across 2 rounds.  
Round 1: drop Bow (no action) and raise Shield (object interaction) -or- use main action to stow the Bow
Round 2: draw Sword (object interaction)"
