@{selected|wtype}&{template:traits} @{selected|charname_output} {{name=Rage}} {{source=Class: Barbarian}} {{description=In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action.

While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren't wearing heavy armor:

+ You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
+ When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll. This bonus increases as you level.
+ You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
+ If you are able to cast spells, you can't cast them or concentrate on them while raging.

Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.

Once you have raged the maximum number of times for your barbarian level, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again. You may rage 2 times at 1st level, 3 at 3rd, 4 at 6th, 5 at 12th, and 6 at 17th.}}
