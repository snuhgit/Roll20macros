The area becomes difficult terrain for the duration. When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes 2d4 piercing damage for every 5 feet it travels. The transformation of the ground is camouflaged to look natural. Any creature that canâ€™t see the area at the time the spell is cast must make a Wisdom (Perception) check against your spell save DC of [[@{selected|spell_save_dc}]] to recognize the terrain as hazardous before entering it.}} {{athigherlevels=}} 0 {{innate=}} {{concentration=1}} @{selected|charname_output}
