As long as the break or tear is no larger than 1 foot in any dimension, you mend it, leaving no trace of the former damage. This spell can physically repair a magic item or construct, but the spell canâ€™t restore magic to such an object.}} {{athigherlevels=}} 0 {{innate=}} 0 @{selected|charname_output}
